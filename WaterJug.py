# You are on the side of the river. You are given  
# a m liter jug and a n liter jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty.  
# The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. 
# You have to use the jugs to measure d liters of water where d < n.  
# Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d liters of water in one of jug.  
# The operations you can perform are:  
# 1.	Empty a Jug 
# 2.	Fill a Jug 
# 3.	Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full. 
 
# There are several ways of solving this problem including BFS and DP. 
# In this article, an arithmetic approach to solving the problem is discussed. 
# The problem can be modeled by means of the Diophantine equation of the form mx + ny = d which is solvable 
# if and only if gcd(m, n) divides d. 
# Also, the solution x,y for which equation is satisfied can be given using the Extended Euclid algorithm for GCD.  

# For example, if we have a jug J1 of 5 liters (n = 5) and another jug J2 of 3 liters (m = 3) 
# and we have to measure 1 liter of water using them.  
# The associated equation will be 5n + 3m = 1.  
# First of all this problem can be solved since gcd(3,5) = 1 which divides 1. 
# Using the Extended Euclid algorithm, we get values of n and m for which the equation is satisfied 
# which are n = 2 and m = -3. 

# Now to find the minimum no of operations to be performed we must decide which jug should be 
# filled first. Depending upon which jug is chosen to be filled and 
# which to be emptied we have two different solutions and the minimum among them would be our answer. 
# Solution 1 (Always pour from m liter jug into n liter jug)  
# 4.	Fill the m litre jug and empty it into n liter jug. 
# 5.	Whenever the m liter jug becomes empty fill it. 
# 6.	Whenever the n liter jug becomes full empty it. 
# 7.	Repeat steps 1,2,3 till either n liter jug or the m liter jug contains d litres of water. 
# Each of steps 1, 2 and 3 are counted as one operation that we perform. 
# Let us say algorithm 1 achieves the task in C1 no of operations. 

# Solution 2 (Always pour from n liter jug into m liter jug)   
# 8.	Fill the n liter jug and empty it into m liter jug. 
# 9.	Whenever the n liter jug becomes empty fill it. 
# 10.	Whenever the m liter jug becomes full empty it. 
# 11.	Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 till either n liter jug or the m liter jug contains d liters of water.
