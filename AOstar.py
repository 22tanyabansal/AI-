# # The AO* method divides any given difficult problem into a smaller group of problems that are then resolved using the AND-OR graph concept. 
# AND OR graphs are specialized graphs that are used in problems that can be divided into smaller problems. 
# The AND side of the graph represents a set of tasks that must be completed to achieve the main goal, 
# while the OR side of the graph represents different methods for accomplishing the same main goal.
# The start state and the target state are already known in the knowledge-based search strategy known as the AO* algorithm, and the best path is identified by heuristics. 
# The informed search technique considerably reduces the algorithmâ€™s time complexity. 
# The AO* algorithm is far more effective in searching AND-OR trees than the A* algorithm.
# Working of AO* algorithm:
# The evaluation function in AO* looks like this:
# f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
# f(n) = Actual cost + Estimated cost
# here,
#           f(n) = The actual cost of traversal.
#           g(n) = the cost from the initial node to the current node.
#           h(n) = estimated cost from the current node to the goal state.
